# Bangs for Google (With Cache)

Automatically use DuckDuckGo for [Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang), keeping Google for all other searches.

## Installation
"Quick Copy URL" is availible through the [Firefox Add-On Platform](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bangs-for-google-with-cache/)

## How does it work? How is the performance?

"Bangs for Google" uses the `webRequest` API, commonly also used in AdBlockers, to catch your Google Search queries before Google even loads. Due to this, the redirects to DuckDuckGo will happen very quickly.

The extension simply checks if you are currently on Google and your search query begins with a "!" - if so, it will redirect you to DuckDuckGo using the same search query.
